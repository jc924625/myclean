## System Design

The "MyClean" booking management system follows a simple and scalable architecture.  
Below is an overview of the system design, including architecture, database model, and user interface wireframes.

### Architecture Diagram
Users interact with the frontend (HTML/CSS/PHP) which communicates with the backend server (Apache/PHP) and the MySQL database.

### Database Design
The system contains three main tables:
- **Users** (for customers, service providers, and admin)
- **Bookings** (managing service appointments)
- **Reviews** (customer feedback on services)

### UI Wireframes
Basic wireframes were created to illustrate key screens:
- Home Page (Login/Register)
- Customer Dashboard (Book Cleaner, View Bookings)
- Provider Dashboard (Manage Requests)
- Admin Panel (Manage Users and Bookings)

### Design Files
All design-related files and diagrams are located in the `/design/` folder.
