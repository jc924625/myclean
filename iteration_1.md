# Iteration 1 - Setup and Initial Development

## Goals for Iteration 1:
- Set up GitHub repository and local development environment
- Install XAMPP and configure Apache and MySQL
- Create initial database `myclean_db` with two tables (`users`, `bookings`)
- Develop basic MVP website structure:
  - Home Page (index.php)
  - User Registration (register.php)
  - User Login (login.php)
- Create basic role-based dashboards (Customer, Provider, Admin)

## Achievements:
- GitHub repository created and organized with proper folders (`src/`, `user_stories/`, `design/`, etc.)
- Database successfully created locally using phpMyAdmin
- Registration and Login systems tested successfully
- User role-based redirection working to different dashboards
- First push of working MVP website files to GitHub completed successfully

## Challenges:
- Faced Git errors while trying to push local project to GitHub (remote already exists, branch issues)
- Solved by using Git commands:
  - Removing incorrect remote
  - Setting correct GitHub remote link
  - Using `git pull --allow-unrelated-histories` to resolve history mismatch

## Reflection and Learning:
- Learned practical Git and GitHub troubleshooting
- Improved skills in setting up PHP projects and MySQL databases
- Understood importance of committing and pushing work regularly
- Prepared strong foundation for next iterations: Booking system and Admin control
