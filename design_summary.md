# System Design Summary

This document summarizes the architectural design, database model, and user interface wireframes for the "MyClean" booking management system.

- **Architecture Diagram** shows how users interact with the frontend (HTML/CSS/PHP) which communicates with the backend (Apache/PHP) and MySQL database.
- **Database Design (ERD)** represents three tables: Users, Bookings, and Reviews, connected via primary and foreign keys.
- **UI Wireframes** depict the structure for Home Page, Customer Dashboard, Provider Dashboard, and Admin Panel.

This design ensures a simple, scalable, and maintainable booking platform for cleaning services.
