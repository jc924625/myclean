# Iteration 2 - Booking System Development

## Goals for Iteration 2:
- Implement Customer functionality to book a cleaner
- Develop Service Provider dashboard to view and manage bookings (accept or reject)
- Build Admin dashboard to view all users and all bookings
- Connect all system parts into a smooth workflow

## Achievements:
- Created a working booking system for customers to book available service providers
- Developed provider dashboard with functionality to accept or reject incoming bookings
- Built admin dashboard displaying all registered users and all bookings
- Successfully tested role-based navigation and functionalities
- Maintained clean database interaction and session control

## Challenges:
- Initial issues with missing database connections (resolved by ensuring all files include `db_config.php`)
- Small GitHub push errors due to branch conflicts (resolved using git pull and setting correct remote)
- Adding admin registration manually (fixed by updating registration form)

## Reflection and Learning:
- Improved understanding of relational database models for multi-role systems
- Learned to properly handle login sessions and redirects based on user role
- Gained practical experience in managing GitHub repositories and pushing updates
- Set a strong foundation for future feature expansions (e.g., payments, messaging between users)
